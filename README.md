# Smart-Face-Alarm
Smart Face Alarm: A Python automation script using OpenCV and Pygame for wake-up verification.
I built a Python-based smart alarm clock that forces you to wake up. The alarm doesn't stop.
The device rings until the computer vision system detects your face for a period of time. The computer vision system must see your face uninterrupted before the ringing stops.

**Features**
- Customizable Alarm Time

**Face Detection using OpenCV**
- Wake-up Verification: 2-second stare needed

**Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- A webcam
- An .mp3 file for the alarm sound


**Installation**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run python main.py
